# ML_KNN:

This code is related to implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) machine learning algorithm.Example of how we can implement code in the Google colab


The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
